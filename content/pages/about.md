Hi, my name is Vladimir, and I work with Navision / Dynamics NAV / Business Central since 2007. I started 3 years after my graduation because my first job was not related to IT it all, I was an account manager. I tried that someone's else suit for almost 1.5 years and then decided I need completely something different, closed to my education. Finally, I found myself in IT but in very specific area where technical knowledge, problem solving and people skills are all demanded.

During my career I've been working on customer side, on a partner/ISV side, on Microsoft side. So at some point I found myself a person who knows the product and its usages from pretty different sides.

I started this blog after BC TechDays 2023 conference to make my small contribution to the community (and I encourage everyone else do the same). I believe that engineer should not only think about purely technical matters, but also on how exactly engineering is delivered to others, how others perceive it, and what impact it creates. At the end, this means we all are humans and how exactly we do our great engineering things also impacts on the end result not only to us but to many people around who use our work as a daily tool.

So here is I am and my new blog about being a Software Engineer - notes and reflections.
